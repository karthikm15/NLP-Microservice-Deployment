# NLP-Microservice-Deployment

In this liveProject, you will be filling the role of a developer tasked with designing, building, and implementing a machine learning solution for your companyâ€™s e-commerce website.

Your company sells a variety of products directly on their own website and via partner websites, which retrieve real-time listings of every product you provide. Customers provide reviews of each product, and their reviews are used to produce ratings of the product.

Until now, the process of turning reviews into ratings has been manual: contractors read through each review, determine how positive or negative each is, and assign a score. The scores from each review are then used to calculate an overall rating for the product.

Your mission is to automate this process, dramatically increasing the speed of rating calculations and decreasing the cost to your company. You will:

Train a machine learning model to score product reviews, recognizing how positive or negative they are.
Expose this model as an API, so that your website and partner companies can display or otherwise utilize automatic product rankings.
Build a small sample webpage to demonstrate this functionality to the executive committee.
